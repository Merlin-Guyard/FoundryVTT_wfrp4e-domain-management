This module is based on home rules allowing the players to build a city from scratch.
It is designed to be played in Mousillon and heavily inspired from theb ook "WFRP 2e - Barony of the Damned".
I'd be more than happy to update it for a wider usage later on would anyone asks for it.

It is currently in french but I'm planning to fully translate it in english when I have time to learn how translations in foundry work.
